# Scorecard for Alternative Assets
The aim is to verify the effectiveness of the scorecard concept on real estate investments in the Morningstar data-base. Fortunately, the
number of classic and alternative investment opportunities increases constantly. An automated scorecard process helps to profit from the 
increased number of investment companies and to improve the due diligence efficiency. The following proven scorecard concept uses 8 quanti-
tative and 2 qualitative factors for the allocation, the selection and the monitoring of the most successful managed investment companies. 
This positive experience with classic liquid investment funds is being verified on real estate investment funds with its described charac-
teristics. Depending on further interest, the gathered data and information is planned to be further used for:

	Due diligence analysis of other real asset investments, such as agricultural, infrastructure, farm-& timberland
	Asset allocation and portfolio risk budgeting including simulation
	Scenario testing and historical performance reviews
